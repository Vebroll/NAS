Virtual NAS in a Docker container.

## Features ✨

 - Multiple disks
 - KVM acceleration
 - Upgrades supported
 
## Usage  🐳

##### Via Docker Compose:

```yaml
services:
  dsm:
    container_name: nas
    image: nas/virtual-nas
    environment:
      DISK_SIZE: "256G"
    devices:
      - /dev/kvm
      - /dev/net/tun
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    ports:
      - 5000:5000
    volumes:
      - ./dsm:/storage
    restart: always
    stop_grace_period: 2m
```

##### Via Docker CLI:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --name dsm -e "DISK_SIZE=256G" -p 5000:5000 --device=/dev/kvm --device=/dev/net/tun --cap-add NET_ADMIN -v "${PWD:-.}/dsm:/storage" --stop-timeout 120 vdsm/virtual-dsm
```

##### Via Kubernetes:

```shell
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vdsm/virtual-dsm/refs/heads/master/kubernetes.yml
```

## FAQ 💬

### How do I use it?

  Very simple! These are the steps:
  
  - Start the container and connect to [port 5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) using your web browser.

  - Wait until NAS finishes its installation
 
  - Choose an username and password, and you will be taken to the desktop.
  
  Enjoy your brand new NAS, and don't forget to star this repo!

### How do I change the storage location?

  To change the storage location, include the following bind mount in your compose file:

  ```yaml
  volumes:
    - ./dsm:/storage
  ```

  Replace the example path `./nas` with the desired storage folder or named volume.
 
### How do I change the size of the disk?

  To expand the default size of 256 GB, locate the `DISK_SIZE` setting in your compose file and modify it to your preferred capacity:

  ```yaml
  environment:
    DISK_SIZE: "512G"
  ```
  
> [!TIP]
> This can also be used to resize the existing disk to a larger capacity without any data loss.

### How do I add multiple disks?

  To create additional disks, modify your compose file like this:
  
  ```yaml
  environment:
    DISK2_SIZE: "500G"
    DISK3_SIZE: "750G"
  volumes:
    - ./example2:/storage2
    - ./example3:/storage3
  ```

### How do I pass-through a disk?

   It is possible to pass-through disk devices or partitions directly by adding them to your compose file in this way:

  ```yaml
  devices:
    - /dev/sdb:/disk1
    - /dev/sdc1:/disk2
  ```

  Make sure it is totally empty (without any filesystem), otherwise NAS may not format it as a volume.

### How do I change the amount of CPU or RAM?

  By default, the container will be allowed to use a maximum of 2 CPU cores and 2 GB of RAM.

  If you want to adjust this, you can specify the desired amount using the following environment variables:

  ```yaml
  environment:
    RAM_SIZE: "4G"
    CPU_CORES: "4"
  ```


  After that you can run the following commands in Linux to check your system:

  ```bash
  sudo apt install cpu-checker
  sudo kvm-ok
  ```

  If you receive an error from `kvm-ok` indicating that KVM cannot be used, please check whether:

  - the virtualization extensions (`Intel VT-x` or `AMD SVM`) are enabled in your BIOS.

  - you enabled "nested virtualization" if you are running the container inside a virtual machine.

  - you are not using a cloud provider, as most of them do not allow nested virtualization for their VPS's.

  If you did not receive any error from `kvm-ok` but the container still complains about a missing KVM device, it could help to add `privileged: true` to your compose file (or `sudo` to your `docker` command) to rule out any permission issue.

### How do I assign an individual IP address to the container?

  By default, the container uses bridge networking, which shares the IP address with the host. 

  If you want to assign an individual IP address to the container, you can create a macvlan network as follows:

  ```bash
  docker network create -d macvlan \
      --subnet=192.168.0.0/24 \
      --gateway=192.168.0.1 \
      --ip-range=192.168.0.100/28 \
      -o parent=eth0 vdsm
  ```
  
  Be sure to modify these values to match your local subnet. 

  Once you have created the network, change your compose file to look as follows:

  ```yaml
  services:
    dsm:
      container_name: nas
      ..<snip>..
      networks:
        vdsm:
          ipv4_address: 192.168.0.100

  networks:
    vdsm:
      external: true
  ```
 
  An added benefit of this approach is that you won't have to perform any port mapping anymore, since all ports will be exposed by default.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This IP address won't be accessible from the Docker host due to the design of macvlan, which doesn't permit communication between the two. If this is a concern, you need to create a [second macvlan](https://blog.oddbit.com/post/2018-03-12-using-docker-macvlan-networks/#host-access) as a workaround.

### How can DSM acquire an IP address from my router?

  After configuring the container for [macvlan](#how-do-i-assign-an-individual-ip-address-to-the-container), it is possible for DSM to become part of your home network by requesting an IP from your router, just like your other devices.

  To enable this mode, in which the container and DSM will have separate IP addresses, add the following lines to your compose file:

  ```yaml
  environment:
    DHCP: "Y"
  devices:
    - /dev/vhost-net
  device_cgroup_rules:
    - 'c *:* rwm'
  ```

### How do I pass-through the GPU?

  To pass-through your Intel GPU, add the following lines to your compose file:

  ```yaml
  environment:
    GPU: "Y"
  devices:
    - /dev/dri
  ```

> [!NOTE]
> This can be used to enable the facial recognition function in Synology Photos, but does not provide hardware transcoding for video.

### How do I install a specific version of NAS?

 not applicable

### What are the differences compared to the standard NAS?



### Is this project legal?

  Yes, this is similar to other projects but is essentially a wrap around linux, and open source project. This project contains only open-source code and does not distribute any copyrighted material. Neither does it try to circumvent any copyright protection measures. So under all applicable laws, this project will be considered legal. 
  
So only run this container on an official NAS hardware, as any other use will be a violation of their terms and conditions.
